    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network (CNN or Convnet) is a class of neural networks, a machine learning algorithm. CNN's are especially good at visual data analysis, such as image classification; by detecting patterins, mostly in the form of shapes (edges, circles, etc) and colours. Before CNN's, computer vision (CV) experts would develop filters manually to detect patterns, e.g. Sobel filter which detects edges. Nowadays with deep learning, specifically with convolutional layers, one can create these filters automatically by training a (convolutional) neural network."

    "Generally machine learning models accuracy is measured in Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, for Neural Networks, it's generally more accurate to use `Cross-Entropy Error` (CSE) to measure accuracy. Suppose a neural network is classifying data and the outcome is a score from 0-1 how sure it is of each possible output label. To measure accuracy we consider  3 seperate inputs for the NN to predict; 2 were predicted correctly, and 1 was wrong. MSE will measure this as a 1/3 classification error, 2/3 correct which results in an 0.67 accuracy score. Whereas `Cross-Entropy error` (CSE) calculates how correct or wrong a given prediction is. E.g a prediction that was just barely right will receive a lower score in CSE than in MSE, same case when a prediction was only just incorrect, MSE sees it as entirely wrong whereas CSE still gives points for being almost right."
